# Huffman-Coding
## Aim
To implement Huffman coding to compress the data using Python.

## Software Required
1. Anaconda - Python 3.7

# Algorithm:
## Step 1:
Assign the input string.

## Step 2:
Create the required tree nodes.

## Step 3:
Create a function to implement the huffman coding.

## Step 4:
Calculate frequency of occurence.

## Step 5:
Print the characters and its Huffman code.
